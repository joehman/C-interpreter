# Mint

Mint is short for my interpreter and is an interpreter written in the C programming language.

## Installation

Clone the repository then run CMake and build the files CMake generates.
It should be cross-compatible and work out of the box since it exclusively uses the C STL.

## Usage

Running the program without arguments opens a python-like commandline environment.
Files can be passed by inputting them as an argument.
